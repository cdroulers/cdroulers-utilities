Allows a shortcut to show a Quake style terminal with a shortcut (configurable in the file, Ctrl + # by default).

Relies on:
- Console2: http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/
- AutoHotKey: http://www.autohotkey.com/
- PowerShell 2

Install:
- Make sure Console2 is in your path, or change the quake-terminal.ahk file to point to the right path.
- Create a shortcut to quake-terminal.ahk in the startup folder
	- Windows 7: (%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)
- Start it the first time, other boots will take care of it.
- Enjoy the Ctrl + # shortcut!

Added awesomeness:
Install cygwin and add the bin path to your environment variable PATH.
BAM, instant access to sweet linux tools!
